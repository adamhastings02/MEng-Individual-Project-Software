The parathyroids could not be identified.

Normal sized thyroid.  No convincing nodule seen within the left lobe.  In the right lobe at the level of the isthmus there are two anteriorly sited subcentimetre spongiform nodules with no internal vascularity (BTS U2 benign).
No lymphadenopathy seen in either side of the neck.

Conclusion: The two right inferior nodules seen on the SPECT/CT are not demonstrated on ultrasound and likely dilated veins. This patient likely has a single right superior parathyroid adenoma.

In addition the patient was unable to lie flat and hyperextend the neck.The thyroid gland is of normal size but there are a number of a solid/cystic nodules throughout the gland.Colloid is identified in the largest nodule which is in the left lobe of the gland and measures 2.5 cm x 1.2 cm x 1.1 cm.  There is no convincing evidence of a parathyroid adenoma.  No significant lymphadenopathy was identified in either the right or left sides of the neck.

Conclusion:  No parathyroid adenoma identified but this should be taken in the context that this was a difficult examination.  If there remains clinical concern a SPECT/CT scan can be considered.The appearances of the thyroid gland are benign in nature.

She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.
